# TPDB v0.35: the swing swung out, no pile in the wind, read a thirty-second time

v0.34 ended with all 64 templates through the gate, for the first time since v0.29. Its list went on to a swept pile of leaves in the wind that "stays neatly in place", and a remark made in five screens running, that the swing hangs still under its motion lines: "The swing ropes hang straight down (at rest) even though motion lines suggest movement".

v0.35 works through those. The swing went to the isolation bench first, drawn three ways and read blind on its own, then into whole test scenes among other events. The set was regenerated and screened a thirty-second time.

The thirty-second screen read all 82 pictures, the set's 21 and 61 probes: 855 of 877 scored items had full marks, and one was misread. The swung swing reads as swinging in all three of its pictures, and no reader says it hangs still; no pile lies in the wind. 63 of 64 templates pass. The one failure, `bucket_hat` (0.89), is that misread, on a picture identical to v0.34's: a grandfather under a bucket was taken for a boy, the bucket covering the hair and cap that say his age.

This screen is a retest: 78 pictures were identical to v0.34's, and 806 of their 830 items scored the same. 17 of the 22 items under full marks are the clouds of two readers who named nothing in the sky.

Everything is built by code and reproducible: the cast is modeled and posed in Blender (Blender 5.2.3 LTS), and the scenes are composed in SVG by the generator in `scenegen/`. From v0.24 the whole cycle also runs on Windows with an installed Blender (`RUNBOOK.md`, Setup).

Source and release history: https://github.com/FoilMiser/Cookie-Theft-Alternative-Scene-Generator- (each release is one commit; `RUNBOOK.md` there says how a release is made).

## What was fixed

| What the v0.34 readers saw | v0.35 |
|---|---|
| "The swing ropes hang straight down (at rest) even though motion lines suggest movement", in five screens running | The seat swung out 12 degrees, the ropes and the child with it, the motion arcs trailing back toward the bottom of the swing, in a frame widened on the side away from the path. On the bench all six readers of a swung seat took the arcs for motion, where two of three readers of the straight one doubted them ("or they could be marks or cracks in the grass") |
| A swept pile of leaves in the wind: "yet the woman's pile of leaves stays neatly in place" | No pile swept or raked in a windy picture, as no water since v0.34 |

Left as it was: the storm pointer's washing, now offered as what the rain will soak ("to bring it in") rather than what the arm points at; and the roller at the top of the painted patch. Left as notes for the pilot: figures overlapping the pond, goats in a garden or park, autumn leaves under summer trees, and hair and clothes that the wind does not move.

## The isolation bench

The child on the swing was forced alone into a picture, cut out with little else around it and read blind by fresh readers (`vision/isolation_v035.md`, one round, 9 cut-outs, 9 readers, one each). The variants are behind `SWING35` in `scenegen/draw.py`; the release builds with the chosen one. Hanging straight, as in v0.34, two of three readers doubted the motion arcs; swung 8 or 12 degrees, all six took them for motion ("The seat and the child are tilted slightly, which fits mid-swing"). The 12 degrees were chosen to show at the scale of a whole picture, where the remark came from. On the bench the frame was widened on both sides; in the first design test its leg stood on the path again, which v0.15 had moved it off, so the release widens it on the side away from the path only and swings the seat that way.

## Design tests

After the bench, the swung swing and revision 33 were read blind in whole test scenes among other events (`vision/design_tests_v035.md`, ten pictures, ten readers). In all eight swing pictures the child is swinging, "pushed out towards the right, with motion lines on her left", and no reader says the swing hangs still. Drawn wider on both sides, as on the bench, the frame's leg stood on the path again in the first picture ("The left front leg of the swing set seems to stand on or right at the edge of the paved path"), so it is widened on the side away from the path only, and only when a child swings; the four swing pictures drawn again read without a word on the path or the frame ("the swing seat tilts noticeably while the child's legs hang down. This fits a swing in motion and doesn't look wrong."). The windy garden draws no remark of a pile lying still, and sweeping and raking still place where there is no wind.

## Placement revision 33

Every record stores the placement revision it was made with. v0.35 pictures use revision 33, which adds to those of revisions 1 to 32 the child on the swing swung out 12 degrees away from the path, in a frame widened on that side; and no pile swept or raked in a windy picture. Both are behind the revision, so v0.34's records rebuild. The cast is v0.34's (builder 0.35.0).

All four tier-4 cells placed on v0.34's seeds under revision 33, the street's on v0.29 to v0.34's forced set, and the tier-3 garden on its seed: 20 of the set's 21 pictures came back identical to v0.34's, the tier-2 garden isomorph differing by its swing, swung out. The tier-4 isomorph took 12 failed attempts, as in v0.33 and v0.34. The first probe pass left `walk_dog`, `dog_begs` and `windy_hat` short, and two more probes filled them. All 82 records rebuild identical to the pixel, and the library passes the validator in full, 343 of 343.

The planner's difficulty priors are the calibration measured on the v0.35 templates (`calibration.json`), with f = 0 and a = 4.47 for every inference and contradiction, as in v0.20 to v0.34. No field moved by 0.002 or more, so the priors are v0.34's.

## The thirty-second blind screen

Nine fresh readers, who had never seen the key, described every picture of the new set and 61 probe pictures; three separate scorers, each given part of the pictures and the same prompt, marked each scored item against the key, exactly as in the earlier screens. The headline figures cover the set; the probe pictures count only toward the templates they carry. Every template appeared in at least three screened pictures, as in v0.10 to v0.34.

Across all 82 pictures 855 of 877 scored items had full marks, and one was misread. The three scorers gave 12, 1 and 9 items under full marks, in 304, 283 and 290; 17 of the 22 are "a few white clouds", in nine of the first reader's ten pictures, one of the second's and seven of the ninth reader's nine. The set's headline is all items 0.982 (0.995 in v0.34), with things at 0.971, actions at 0.996, inferences at 0.957 and contradictions at 1.00, every item under full marks on a picture identical to v0.34's: three of the clouds, the dog on the hose "standing on or right beside the hose" twice, a dropped ice cream and a balloon.

**A sixth retest.** 78 pictures, 20 of the set's and 58 probes, were identical to the pixel in v0.34 and v0.35. 806 of their 830 items scored the same; 7 moved up and 17 down, 12 of the 17 the clouds.

**Remarks were 2.88 a picture, 236 on 82 pictures**, from 2.44 to 3.50 a reader. On the 78 identical pictures they fell from 243 to 222. The swing reads picture by picture: "The girl on the swing looks like she is swinging normally and enjoying it", and once "The girl's swing ropes do not quite look like they come from directly above the seat, but it reads as swinging". The washing is offered again as what a storm pointer points at, on the same unchanged seed, and the grandfather in the bucket hat is the v0.36 list's first item.

What this release redrew or ruled (mean of each template's scored items; inference and contradiction items alone in the last column):

| Template | v0.34 | v0.35 | v0.35 meaning items |
|---|---|---|---|
| `swing` | 1.00 (3 items) | 1.00 (3 items) | — |
| `sweep` | 1.00 (12 items) | 1.00 (11 items) | — |
| `rake` | 1.00 (3 items) | 1.00 (3 items) | — |
| `sweep_fork` | 1.00 (9 items) | 1.00 (9 items) | 1.00 (6) |

`swing` holds at 1.00, swung out. `sweep`, `rake` and `sweep_fork`, kept out of the wind, all hold at 1.00.

### The legibility gate

| Gate outcome | v0.9 | v0.9 retest | v0.10 | v0.11 | v0.12 | v0.13 | v0.14 | v0.15 | v0.16 | v0.17 | v0.18 | v0.19 | v0.20 | v0.21 | v0.22 | v0.23 | v0.24 | v0.25 | v0.26 | v0.27 | v0.28 | v0.29 | v0.30 | v0.31 | v0.32 | v0.33 | v0.34 | v0.35 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Pass (mean at least 0.9, at least two pictures, no misread) | 54 | 59 | 59 | 59 | 63 | 61 | 63 | 61 | 63 | 63 | 60 | 60 | 64 | 61 | 63 | 64 | 63 | 61 | 59 | 63 | 61 | 64 | 63 | 63 | 63 | 63 | 64 | 63 |

Every template was screened in at least three pictures (52 in three, 4 in four, 4 in five, 2 in six and 2 in eleven), and 63 of 64 pass. The failure is `bucket_hat` (0.89), on a picture identical to v0.34's, where the item had full marks: its grandfather was "a boy in a white shirt, brown waistcoat and dark trousers", and v0.34's reader of the same picture wrote "I can't see the bucket-wearing man's hair, so I can't tell his age". The gate is a filter, and the pilot with people is the test of difficulty.

Templates that did not pass (`vision/flaws_v035.md` gives what the readers saw and the next fix):

| Template | v0.35 mean | Pictures | Misreads |
|---|---|---|---|
| `bucket_hat` | 0.89 (9 items) | 3 | 1 |

## Key words, frequency and age of acquisition


Unchanged from v0.20: every item record carries its key word's Zipf frequency (f, for things and actions only) and its
age of acquisition (a, from the bundled excerpt of Kuperman, Stadthagen-Gonzalez and Brysbaert, 2012) at weight 0;
`scenegen/norms/aoa_kuperman2012.tsv` keeps the citation and source in its header and every record stores its sha256.
The licence note and what the pilot should test are in the v0.20 README section of the same name (the CC BY-NC-ND 3.0
question about shipping an excerpt; the model with AoA against the model without, pre-registered; AoA kept varying apart
from frequency when choosing the pilot's pictures). Before the pilot, check the bundled rows against the original file
(`python -m scenegen.difficulty --check-aoa <the original .xlsx or .csv>`).

## Folders

## How to run

```bash
python -m venv .venv && source tools/env.sh      # from Git Bash on Windows too
pip install -r requirements.txt                  # the cast needs Blender 5.2.3 LTS: installed, or pip install bpy==5.2.3 on Python 3.13

python assets/cast/build_cast.py assets/cast/out035                 # build the cast (under a minute)
cd assets/cast && python gapcheck.py out035 person.kai && cd ../..  # check one character's poses for parts that come apart
python -m scenegen.generate --tier 3 --setting playground --seed 7 --out scenes
python -m scenegen.generate --from-record scenes/T3_park_s2023.json --out tpdb_work/check   # exact rebuild
python -m scenegen.reach --out reach.json                          # the poses the templates can ask for

python -m scenegen.batch showcase --out scenes
python -m scenegen.calibrate --out calibration.json
python -m scenegen.difficulty --check-aoa <the original Kuperman et al. file>   # compare the bundled AoA rows
python -m scenegen.combos --out combos.json
BENCH_CAST=<a cast built with TPDB_PROFILE=0> python vision/isolation_bench.py tpdb_work/bench proO_1 proO_2   # one template alone, cropped
python vision/prepare_screen.py scenes,probes vision/v035   # then describe and score: vision/screen_prompts.md
bash tools/cycle/summarize.sh                               # add the screen to vision/screen_summary.json
python vision/gate.py vision/v035 scenes,probes
python -m scenegen.site --scenes scenes --gallery assets/cast/gallery035 --old-gallery <v0.34 renders of the same variants> \
    --combos combos.json --screen vision/screen_summary.json --out site
python3 package_release.py 0.35 --single   # the release as one zip, tpdb_v0.35.zip
```

The release is one zip, `tpdb_v0.35.zip`, about 192 MB. Google Drive does not virus-scan a file over 100 MB, so it asks to confirm the download ("can't scan this file for viruses"); the file downloads as normal after that. `package_release.py` checks, file by file, that the zip holds every file of the release. Without `--single` it writes the same release as zip parts under 50 MB each, with the README and the set's pictures beside them, for browsing in Drive.

Exact rebuilds hold within a release: a v0.34 record rebuilds with the v0.34 package. They also depend on Pillow, pinned in `requirements.txt`: Pillow 13 resamples RGBA differently from 12, and every embedded asset changes. A different cairo moves a few pixels by one level and leaves the SVG identical. Renders from an installed Blender differ from the Linux module's only in sub-pixel anti-aliasing on the outlines, with identical anchors and geometry, so the library mixes the two.

## Known limits

- The weights are still the spec's starting values: every predicted completeness is a placeholder
  until the pilot fit.
- The blind screen used AI readers. It is a filter for illegible drawing; the pilot with people
  remains the test of difficulty.
- One template falls under the legibility gate after the v0.35 screen, `bucket_hat` (0.89), on the screen's one misread, a picture identical to v0.34's: a grandfather under
  a bucket, which covers the grey hair and cap that say his age, was taken for a boy. 63 of 64 pass. `vision/flaws_v035.md` lists this and the oddities for v0.36.
- A single half mark is noise. 19 pictures were identical to the pixel in v0.29 and v0.30, and 223 of their 230 items scored the same across fresh readers and scorers, with four templates moving by a half mark and no picture changed (`vision/flaws_v030.md`, A retest nobody planned). In v0.31, 12 pictures came back identical once more, and 137 of their 141 items scored the same; the one that went down is the gate's one failure. In v0.32, 19 came back identical, and 242 of their 246 items scored the same; the four that went down are again the gate's one failure, and a begging dog's half mark. In v0.33, 21 came back identical, and 274 of their 281 items scored the same, three moving up and four down. In v0.34, 26 came back identical, and 296 of their 299 items scored the same, two moving up and one down. In v0.35, 78 came back identical, and 806 of their 830 items scored the same, 7 moving up and 17 down, 12 of the 17 the clouds of two readers who named nothing in the sky. A template with few items can cross the gate on that alone: `read_bench` has one item to a picture.
- What the trip's long box costs a fresh tier-4 search is as v0.29 found it, 166 failed seeds against 80. In v0.32 the garden, park and playground cells came back on their seeds; the street's did not under revision 30, in 39 seeds, and placed at once with v0.31's template set forced. In v0.33 all four came back unchanged, the street's on the same forced set, and in v0.34 and v0.35 all four came back on their seeds again.
- The oddities come in two rows. Readers' remarks per picture are counted directly from their descriptions and compare across
  screens, with the caveat that current readers write about 18% more than the v0.23 readers on the same pictures (`vision/v024/control/`,
  one reader and eight pictures). The row was recounted in v0.26, as the counter had taken bullets saying nothing is wrong for remarks, so its
  figures differ from those published up to v0.25. The scorers' logged oddities do not compare: v0.23's logged 25% of the remarks, v0.24's 83%, and
  from v0.25 the prompt caps them at three per picture. Earlier screens did not record which model read them; v0.24's to v0.35's ran on Claude Opus 5.5. Readers differ widely: on v0.28's nine, from 4.25 to 6.38 remarks a picture, on v0.29's from 4.50 to 5.75, and on v0.30's from 4.50 to 6.12. v0.31's nine wrote from 2.62 to 4.43, every one fewer than the fewest of v0.30's, and on 12 pictures identical in both screens remarks fell from 65 to 45. So a screen's readers can move the row by a third, and its fall to 3.51 in v0.31 says nothing about the drawings. v0.32's nine wrote from 2.71 to 4.43, 3.28 a picture, and on 19 pictures identical in both screens remarks fell from 79 to 67. v0.33's nine wrote from 2.44 to 4.11, 3.19 a picture, and on 21 identical pictures remarks rose from 77 to 88. v0.34's nine wrote from 2.40 to 4.50, 3.13 a picture, and on 26 identical pictures remarks were 96 in both. v0.35's nine wrote from 2.44 to 3.50, 2.88 a picture, and on 78 identical pictures remarks fell from 243 to 222.
- No reader says "teenager": he is read as a boy, a boy or young man, or a person, which the key mostly accepts. The v0.24 redraw moved him
  from a woman to a boy, and v0.26's cap worn forwards moved him no further toward the key's own word. It read once as "worn backward or sideways" in v0.27.
- The retest of the v0.9 pictures (`vision/retest_v09.md`) put the gate's reader variance at about five
  templates between screens. A template with one to three items per picture fails on a single picture
  where something next to it pulls the reading away: the gate is a filter, not a measurement.
- Scores are near the ceiling: across 82 pictures 855 of 877 scored items had full marks (874 of 885 in v0.34), 17 of the 22
  others the clouds of two readers who named nothing in the sky. AI readers describe
  exhaustively, so the screen cannot rank templates by difficulty; that is the pilot's job.
- Scorers differ on hedges: some give full marks when the description commits to the key's reading and
  only the "unsure" section offers another, some give a half point. The prompt allows both; two v0.17 scorers
  counted 6 and 13 such items they credited in full, a v0.18 scorer listed seven judgment calls, a v0.19 scorer six,
  a v0.20 scorer seven, a v0.21 scorer nine, v0.22 scorers two, eight and nine, v0.23 scorers six to twelve, a v0.24 scorer eleven, and all three scorers of v0.25 to v0.35 listed such calls, enough to move a template across the gate. A v0.29 scorer listed 18 items that hold full marks because the free description committed and only the unsure section hedged, and a v0.30 scorer gave nothing under full marks in 302 and listed 22 it thought a stricter scorer might halve. Two v0.31 scorers gave nothing under full marks, in 236 and 253 items, among them a bird "about to take it" credited as pecking. v0.32's three gave one, three and three items under full marks, in 244, 288 and 244, v0.33's four, one and three, in 301, 255 and 306, v0.34's one, none and ten, in 314, 282 and 289, where the second listed four inferences a stricter scorer might halve, and v0.35's twelve, one and nine, in 304, 283 and 290. A misread is a call too: the
  rake in v0.26's picture 37 could have been marked as sweeping half right.
- Tier-4 pictures are the hardest to place, and revisions 14 to 26 make them harder (walkers' and runners' lanes, pointing
  lines, feet off benches and off other events' things, the photographer's line of sight, the waver's clear hand, body gaps, the gap
  from thin parts, heads clear of figures up to 80 px apart in depth, the ground clear past a reading walker's obstacle, jumpers in the
  front half, an obstacle a full step ahead, runners clear of other movers, ducks off a float, sleepers clear of walkers' feet, nobody in
  the strip before the horizon, a person's box off the lamp post, the ground kept clear round a begging dog). A tier-4 playground plan now holds the bird stealing a sandwich and the
  square wheel, has no swing set as scenery and counts the railing up to 30% hidden, each of which alone placed nothing from 12 seeds, where all three placed 2 (`vision/flaws_v028.md`). So every tier-4 playground has those two, and none
  has the begging dog. A tier-4 street plan holds the bird too, on the evidence of one picture. A picture that also holds a floating, carried or soaked box falls back to the bucket from the long box, and none of the eleven screened pictures of the trip did.
- The square-wheeled bicycle still stands on its own: four stands have been tried on the bench, and each
  read as something else (pedals, legs) or not at all.
- The low kick's direction is ambiguous when the kicker's hair hides the face; the teenager kicks first,
  and the kick read in full in all its screened pictures. His cap now points the way he faces, but two readers still took it for sideways or backwards.
- The stuck girl on the seesaw always calls out, and from v0.33 no kick arcs are drawn at her feet: the tilt, the man's weight, her open mouth and
  the raised handle carry the reading, and in the v0.33 and v0.34 screens she was stuck in all three of her pictures.
- The body check (`assets/cast/gapcheck.py`) finds parts that come apart, not parts that pass through one
  another: a hand inside a hip or a lobe of skirt inside the bell is allowed, and only the outline drawn
  in the render shows whether the join looks right.
- The wind reaches the hat, the washing, an empty swing, the tree and the sky, but not hair or clothes, nor the
  bushes and flowers (three v0.19 probe readers noticed): the cast is posed and rendered in 3D, and a blowing
  fringe or skirt would be a new rig. From revision 32 no can, pan, hose or sprinkler pours in a windy picture, and from revision 33 no pile is
  swept or raked in one (in v0.34 one lay still: "yet the woman's pile of leaves stays neatly in place").
- The isolation bench reads one template cut out of its picture. A visual that reads alone can still be
  misread among other events, so the bench comes before the test scenes and the screen, never instead of them.
- The planner's priors come from the v0.35 calibration, with f = 0 and a at its centre for every inference and contradiction, as in
  v0.20 to v0.34: no field moved by 0.002 or more, so the priors are v0.34's. The ladder's still rests on one sampled placement, since v0.29's lamp rule.
- Exact rebuilds hold within a release, on the pinned Pillow: the v0.35 placement rules (revision 33) swing the child on the swing out, widen the frame for it, and keep
  a pile out of the wind, so a v0.34 record rebuilds with the v0.34 package. Revisions 31 to 33 keep their rules in the templates' placement, each behind its revision, and six
  v0.34 records tried, two swing gardens, the windy sweeper and the tier-4 garden among them, rebuilt identical under v0.35's code; revision 30's sky rule is still read at
  import (`RUNBOOK.md`).
- Every variant comes from the v0.35 cast (builder 0.35.0, `out035`), which draws as v0.34's: what the set and probes use was carried over from `lib034`, or rendered on demand on an installed Blender, the seesaw's riders in two pieces each. Some carried variants date from Linux renders, which differ from an installed Blender's
  only in sub-pixel anti-aliasing on the outlines. The library keeps only the 343 variants the v0.35 set and probes use. The bench
  variants (`TPDB_PROFILE`, `TPDB_FOOT`, `TPDB_BROOM`, `TPDB_ICE`, `TPDB_BOOK`, `TPDB_MOUTH`, `TPDB_BODY`, `TPDB_PECK`, `TPDB_DRESS`, `TPDB_NOZ`, `TPDB_BEARD`, `TPDB_BROW`, `TPDB_BLUSH`, `draw.WHEEL27`, `draw.SPLAT28`, `draw.SEESAW_IN28`, `draw.SWING35`, `library.SHADOW28`, `library.SHADOW29`, and `SLEEP29`, `TRIP29`, `TRIP_OBJ29`, `DUCK29`, `DOOR29`, `HOSE29`, `BULGE29`, `FISH29`, `LADDER_LAMP29`, `HOSE30`, `FISH30`, `TRIP_W30`, `TRIP_LANE30`, `CRUMB30`, `SEESAW31`, `RIDE31`, `CASTLE31`, `LIMB31`, `LOW32`, `LOW_IN32`, `LOW_RISE32`, `LOW_RISE_B32`, `STUCK32`, `HANDLE32`, `HOSE33` and `KICK33` in `templates.py`, `REEL30` and `REEL31` in `settings.py`, and `TPDB_VEST`, `TPDB_CONE`, `TPDB_BOX`, `TPDB_LOW`, `TPDB_SEAT34` and `TPDB_HAIR34` in the cast) stay in the code.
- The figures are still narrow. Legs an eighth shorter and limbs 14% thicker took the bench from eight remarks to three, on four cut-outs a side, but the screen's remarks on
  thin or long bodies did not fall (six pictures to eight in v0.27, to thirteen in v0.28 and v0.29, and back to six in v0.30, with nothing changed, and one each in v0.31 and v0.32, with readers who remark less; by keyword, so that row says little). A real change of build is a larger job than these.
- A person in full profile has the head turned 35 degrees to the viewer, baked as a twin action of the pose (`__p`), except where a hand-held thing at the face would be left behind
  (`PROFILE_SKIP`). Those poses keep the hidden face readers remark on.
- Age of acquisition is recorded at weight 0, so it moves nothing until the pilot's pre-registered test says it
  should. The bundled ratings are a verbatim excerpt of Kuperman et al. (2012) under CC BY-NC-ND 3.0, taken from a
  copy in the lftk package; they have not yet been checked against the original file at crr.ugent.be.
- Key words follow one rule (the word the first accepted answer names: an action's verb, or the thing that names
  it), applied by hand in v0.20 and unchanged since; a key that is itself an accepted answer was left alone.
- The sleeping cat, 1.4 times its v0.17 size, read as "small" in one v0.18 probe and drew no remark in its four
  v0.19 pictures; drawn larger, the standing and stalking cats would come out as big as the small white dog.
- Twenty-seven actions in the cast are used by no template; they are kept for later templates and left
  out of the gallery and the screen, so they have never been read blind.
- Edge density is not part of the isomorph rule. Street pictures stay the busiest, so a street
  isomorph of a park or playground picture carries more visual detail at the same object count.
- The top third of park and playground pictures is still mostly sky.
- A filler closer than 24 px to the picture's side edge is now moved 30 px inside it, and no reader said one
  was cut off; the sun can still sit partly off the top edge, where the backdrop draws it.
- The strip before the horizon leaves the playground less room: the tier-3 playground placed only without template-variety steering in
  v0.24 and v0.25, and with it from v0.26. The v0.35 isomorphs are two at tier 2, two at tier 3 and one at tier 4, four identical to v0.34's and the tier-2 garden's differing by its swing, swung out; the tier-4 one
  took 12 failed attempts.
- The strip applies to the park and the playground, not the street, where the back row stands at the shop fronts: one design-test
  reader still found a woman there "large compared with the door".
- A shadow from the figure's own footprint is smaller, and a body lying down has little of it showing. The sleeping dog now reads in full on its new pose and that shadow; a wider one did little on the bench, so whether the shadow cost it marks in v0.28 is still not shown.
- The trip reads in full on the long box, in eleven pictures in v0.30 and five each in v0.31 to v0.35. In v0.30, five of its readers also said the walker may step round it, which on the same five pictures went from four of five to one of five with nothing changed.
- The man on the seesaw's low end is drawn astride, his far leg behind the plank. The v0.32 bench turned him away, or put both legs behind the plank, and readers of each still doubted his seat (legs out was set aside on looking);
  in the v0.32 screen he drew one remark in three pictures, that "the seesaw plank seems to pass behind or among the old man's legs". He is off the list; in v0.33 his legs over the plank drew a remark once more. The stuck girl holds a handle raised with her,
  and once a reader saw her hover, from the kick arcs under her feet, which v0.33 does not draw.
- A rider on the seesaw is two pictures, the far leg drawn behind the plank as background and the rest of the figure in front. The far leg is in no count, mask or check of the scene's own.
  Until v0.32 the validator failed the 12 pieces on their names; it now checks each by its base pose and leaves the ground rule to the piece with the body.
- The child on the swing is swung out 12 degrees (revision 33), turned in the picture with its seat and ropes, not posed so in the cast. The frame is widened on the
  side away from the path when a child swings, so its legs stay off the path, and an empty seat keeps the frame it had. One v0.35 reader found the ropes not quite
  "directly above the seat", and read the child as swinging.
- The cast is a stand-in. Final character art would replace the models; rigs, poses, faces,
  anchors and manifests carry over.
